          Young Ronald has always had intrest in breaking things apart and trying to put them back together... sometimes I was never sucessful so I would end up with broken toys most of the times. This is what inspired me into the IT world. I have been watching technology involve/grow as years goes by. Quiclky the ambition of learning how technology works and conncects fueled my intrest in the IT World
